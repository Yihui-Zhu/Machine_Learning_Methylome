## Title: Machine learning analysis of whole-genome methylation data reveals novel prediction on tetrahydrofolate level in placenta tissue

### Abstract
Folic acid is an essential vitamin, especially for women who are pregnant or planning to be pregnant. It is the primary methyl donor for methylation reaction in one-carbon pathway which are required by DNA synthesis, repair and methylation. Prenatal vitamins, including folate can offer offspring protection by decreasing neural tube defaults. Lacking methyl donor can lead to abnormal gene methylation patterns which will increase the risk of developmental programming. 

Epigenetics is defined as stable modifications to nucleotides or chromosomes without alternations to the underlying DNA sequence. Epigenetics, especially DNA methylation of the major metabolic pathways at intrauterine development this critical window has been implicated with metabolic and neuronal developmental programming that related with various neurodevelopmental disorders. DNA methylation shows the variability during fetal and contains molecular memory with in utero experiences such as folic acid. 

Placenta tissue, usually discarded at birth, is a potentially rich source for studying DNA methylation patterns similar to oocytes and pre-implantation states of development. Placenta plays a crucial role in transferring nutrients, exchanging wastes and gas, and protecting the fetus from infections, which plays a vital role in embryo development and growth.

Currently, folic acid measurements are complex and expensive by metabolic measurement. Those measurements also variable by batches and instruments. This project investigated on multiple machine learning prediction models on folic acid levels with direct measurement in placenta by using placental DNA methylation on matched samples. Nearest neighbor model generated the best prediction rate, followed by random forest, decision tree and neural networks. All four models had high prediction accuracy on folate levels.
